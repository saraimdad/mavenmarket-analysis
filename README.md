- Tables were created for customers, products, sales transactions, and inventory.
- Relationships between tables were established.

#### 3. Adding Calculated Fields:
- Additional fields were calculated to derive meaningful insights using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
- Metrics such as total profit, total revenue, and product popularity were computed to aid decision-making.

#### 4. Designing an Interactive Report:
- An interactive report was designed to present key findings and allow stakeholders to explore the data.
- Visualization tools such as charts and graphs were utilized for intuitive data representation.
- User-friendly interfaces were developed to enable easy navigation and customization of reports.
